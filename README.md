# To-Do List

> In this project, I built a simple HTML list of To Do tasks. The list is styled according to the specifications listed in the lesson. This simple web page is built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server. In this part of the project, I made the app interactive; such that one can clear all checked tasks.

## Built With

  *Major languages:*

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- Webpack dev server

## Live Demo

[To do List Live app](https://krisbobo.github.io/todoList-app/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

Before attempting to get a copy of this, you should know(have) how to do the following:

- How to use the command line interface(CLI)

- Know how to navigate directories or folders at the CLI.

- Know how to get the URL(https/ssh) of a repository on GitHub.

- You should have a code editor installed, preferably VsCode.

## Setup

- In desired folder or directory in the CLI, run the command:

>                   git clone git@github.com:krisbobo/todo-list.git

-Navigate into the cloned folder or repository by running the command:

>                   cd <folder/name of the repository>

- If VsCode is your default code editor, run:

>                   code .

- You are all setup!

## Usage

- While in the desired directory, run the code:

>                   npm install

This will install all dependencies on your local machine.

- Then, do:

>                   npm run build

- Finally, run:

>                   npm start

This will start up the dev server for the live version
